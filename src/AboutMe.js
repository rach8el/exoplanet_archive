        My name is <b>Rachael Hooker.</b> I am a <b>music enthusiast, dreamer, problem solver, and a learner. </b>
         My mission is to create things that can help people with technology, like designing websites that everyone can use to help students learn or using solar powered tools to fight climate change . 
        I plan to do it by expanding my knowledge of coding as well as practicing it, even using it professionally. 
        My desired outcome is to at least help one person. If I can do that, then I’m sure I can help many others. 
        In addition to supporting people, I’d also like to help the earth. 
        Since climate change is a huge issue in the world and something I've been interested in since I was a kid, it’d bring me some relief to know that I’d have a part in fighting it.
      <hr />
      I aspire to leave a legacy where I've <b>helped mainly local communities achieve a more healthy climate and accessible places on the internet, by creating a website that educates people about carbon footprints and lists eco friendly products and business we can all use more often. </b>
      I’d like to also create a website layout that has improved navigation for all users, which increases engagement and accessibility.
      I want to do all of this hard work to attempt to make the world a better place. 
      Growing up, you’ve most likely seen news headlines about the polar ice caps melting, or a devastating impact happening, such as an economic recession. 
      Since I was a kid, I’ve wanted to do something to be part of an important cause. 
      Therefore in the future, I hope to be a part of the solution to these issues, contributing alongside scientists while utilizing technology to solve problems.
